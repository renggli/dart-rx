Reactive Extensions Library for Dart providing an API for asynchronous programming with observable streams.

Reactive is created in the style of [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.github.io/), and does not depend on Dart Streams. Though there are converters to and from `Stream` and `Future` instances. At this point this code is quite experimental, and might miss features or have serious bugs.

This library is open source and well tested. Development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/renggli/dart-rx). Feel free to report issues or create a pull-request there. General questions are best asked on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rx+dart).

The package is hosted on [dart packages](https://pub.dev/packages/rx). Up-to-date [class documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/rx/latest/) is created with every release.
